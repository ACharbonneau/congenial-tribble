## Mappings

CDA currently collects data from 3 sources:
- [GDC](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)
- [PDC](https://pdc.cancer.gov/pdc/)
- [IDC](https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/)


The CDA uses a simple model to describe connections between metadata fields. Contents for the metadata fields are taken directly from our data partners and made searchable without transformation or harmonization. See individual breakouts of the tables below under Mapping in the left side bar.
