title: Mapping Overview
---

CDA currently collects data from three data sources:

- [The Genomic Data Commons (GDC)](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/)
- [The Proteomic Data Commons (PDC)](https://pdc.cancer.gov/pdc/)
- [The Imaging Data Commons (IDC)](https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/)


The CDA uses a simple model to describe common data descriptors and the connections between them. Contents for the metadata fields are taken directly from the data sources and made searchable without transformation or harmonization. See individual breakouts of the tables below under Mapping in the left side bar.
