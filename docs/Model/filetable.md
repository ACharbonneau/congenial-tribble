title: File Endpoint fields
---

The file endpoint uses a file attributes first schema to enable faster search, but contains all the same data as the subject endpoint.

Column names that have a `.` between words denote that the term after the `.` is a nested field. Nesting structure can be more easily browsed in the [file JSON schema](./files_schema.md)
