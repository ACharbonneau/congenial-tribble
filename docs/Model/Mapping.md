title: CDA Model and Mapping to Data Providers

## CDA Model

The CDA uses a simple model to describe connections between metadata fields. Contents for the metadata fields are taken directly from our data partners and made searchable without transformation or harmonization. This simplified ER diagram shows the CDA endpoints, what metadata is directly associated with each, and what fields are used to associate between endpoints.
